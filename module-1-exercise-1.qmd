## Part A: Setting up R and RStudio

1. **Install R and RStudio**  
   - Download and install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org).  
   - Download and install RStudio Desktop.  

2. **Check version**

```{r}
#| eval: false
version
```


## Part B: Packages and Help Pages

1. **Install and load a package.**

2. **Install the tidyverse package:**


```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

- Verify that the package loaded successfully.
- Explore help pages
- Use the help function to learn about mean():

```{r}
#| eval: false

?mean
help(mean)
```

- Summarize what the function does and the arguments it accepts.


## Part C: R Objects

1. **Create basic objects**

2. **Create a numeric vector**


```{r}
#| eval: false
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
```

- Create a character vector:

```{r}
#| eval: false
names <- c("Anna", "Ben", "Carla")
```

- Create a data frame:

```{r}
#| eval: false
df <- data.frame(ID = 1:3, Name = names, Score = c(85, 90, 88))
```


- Inspect objects
- Use functions like class(), length(), str(), and summary() to explore the objects.

## Part D: R Notation

1. **Indexing and subsetting**

    - Extract the 3rd element of vector x.
    - Extract the Score column from df.
    - Extract the second row of df.

2. **Applying functions**

    - Compute the mean of vector x.
    - Compute the mean of the Score column in df.
